## **4. The Philosophy and Framework of `getFinFree()`**
- Core belief: **Wealth is a by-product of clarity and discipline**  
- Freedom as the ultimate ROI of well-designed systems  
- Compounding as a life philosophy, not just a math formula  
- The 5+1 function model of financial freedom:

## **6. A Note to the Reader**
- This is not a “get-rich” book — it’s a “get-free” one  
- You can start anywhere, but commit to building your full system  
- Reflect, iterate, and personalize your financial framework  
- Closing idea:  
  > “You can’t control markets, luck, or outcomes —  
  > but you can design your systems.  
  > And systems, over time, create freedom.”
