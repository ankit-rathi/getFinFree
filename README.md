# 📘 getFinFree(): The Code to Financial Freedom

*A systems-thinking approach to personal finance inspired by compounding, data, and life.*

---

## 🧭 Overview

This book treats **financial freedom like building software** — structured, logical, and iterative.  
Each part is a function, each chapter a subroutine, and each lesson a reusable module.  
You’ll go from *earning actively* to *compounding passively* — by building systems that outperform motivation.
